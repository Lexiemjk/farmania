## Project Scope :

I'm new in minecraft development, and it's my first project.
I want to create this mod for two reason :

    - Improve my skills in java and forge dev
    - Create a complete and complex mod that I like.

The theme here is food and witchcraft,
I want to create an all new way to see food in mc,
with new dynamics like buffs, magical food and plants, new hunger system, ...

If someone sees this project (it won't happen tho), I'm only searching for idea by now,
if you have suggestion, tell me !

## Project Goals and Objectives :

    - Create new aspects of food in Minecraft
    - New way to improve your stats (buff, ...)
    - ...
